lnd microservice
now on LND mainnet!
#craefulgang

you can test this on your machine by installing LND via the instructions here:
https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md

After you have LND:

`git clone https://github.com/callmekurisu/adWatcher.git`<br>
`cd adWatcher`<br>
`npm install` <br>
`nodemon index.js`

You will need to configure for localhost testing as this version is currently running on my server.

The LND API Reference is located here: http://api.lightning.community/?javascript#lnd-api-reference
*LND API is not working for me as of 23MAR18. Using node-cmd as a bypass"
